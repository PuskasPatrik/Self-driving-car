The self driving car base is a modified RC car. The brain of the system is the PI3B, which has a camera connected to it. An Arduino UNO DEV 3 is also used. Inside there is 2 microcontrollers, one for the back engine, and 4 HCSR04 sensors to calculate distance in every direction. The other one is connected to the front wheels to move the wheel in the right direction. An onboard accelerometer tracks the number of laps completed. A rechargeable 5V battery provides power to all components, and a compact cooling fan is installed to prevent the system from overheating during extended use.

The program is responsible for continuously reading sensor data from various onboard systems and calculate distance in a txt file, giving a command to the wheels to turn into the right direction and avoid any object in the way. If it would fail to avoid it, then it stops before the obstacle and then the car will start to go backwards and correct the position to try to get out of the way of the obstacle. In addition to the sensors, the system is also integrated with a front facing camera that captures real time images of the area ahead. These visual inputs are used to enhance obstacle detection and avoidance, enabling the car to make more informed decisions. By combining data from both the sensors and the camera, the program provides a more comprehensive understanding of the surroundings, which improves the overall safety and effectiveness of the carâ€™s autonomous navigation system.
